# SIG Systems Shell

This shell is the [UIC ACM](https://acmuic.org/)'s SIG Systems' first project!

## Guides
### Getting started running the shell
1. Use the [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) Rust installer to get your environment setup and ready to build the shell.
    - There are `rustup` installers available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
      - Linux and MacOS users need only to run a quick command.
2. Use `git clone` to clone this repo, then `cd` into it.
3. Run `cargo run` in your terminal to startup the (quite unfinished) shell.
4. Make some changes to `src/main.rs` then type `cargo run` again to see what changes!

### Getting started collaborating 
1. Fork the repository with the "Fork" button in the top right.
2. Either clone the newly-forked repository or (if you sufficiently understand `git`), add it as a new remote.
3. Make, commit, and push your changes (to your forked repo).
4. On the GitHub page for your forked repo, under the "Contribute" button on top, press "Open pull request"
5. Write a brief description of what your code changes do.
6. Press the "Create pull request" button.
7. Watch your email for updates!
